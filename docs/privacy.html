      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 18, 2026</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Better Self App ("we", "our", or "the App") is committed to protecting
        your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect,
        how it is used, and how it is shared.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        The App collects daily activity information such as workout data, diet
        logs, and other actions you record. Some actions may involve capturing
        photos via your device camera.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store any personal information
        such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.
      </p>

      <h2>Apple Health Integration</h2>
      <p>
        With your explicit permission, the App accesses Apple Health data to
        automatically track:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sleep data:</strong> Duration and quality metrics to calculate
          sleep points
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Workout data:</strong> Activity type, duration, and intensity
          to calculate workout points
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This health data is processed locally on your device. We do
        <strong>not</strong> store raw health data on our servers. Only
        aggregated point values derived from this data are recorded for
        leaderboard purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can revoke Apple Health access at any time through your device's
        Settings app.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store any personal information
        such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Track your daily progress for self-improvement.</li>
        <li>
          Calculate points based on your recorded actions and health data.
        </li>
        <li>Display points on a leaderboard shared with other users.</li>
        <li>Unlock achievements based on your activity milestones.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your data is anonymized and only used in aggregate to maintain the
        leaderboard and personal progress tracking.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> share any personal information with third
        parties. The only shared data is the anonymized activity points for the
        leaderboard.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable security measures to protect your activity data,
        but no system can guarantee complete security.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The App is not intended for children under 18. We do not knowingly
        collect personal information from children.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be
        posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
      </p>
