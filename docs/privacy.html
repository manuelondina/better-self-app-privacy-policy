      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Better Self App ("we", "our", or "the App") is committed to protecting
        your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect,
        how it is used, and how it is shared.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        The App collects daily activity information such as workout data, diet
        logs, and other actions you record. Some actions may involve capturing

      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store any personal information
        such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.

      <h2>Apple Health and HealthKit Integration</h2>
      <p>
        Better Self App integrates with Apple Health (HealthKit) to provide
        automatic health data tracking. This section explains exactly how we use
        your health data.

          <strong>Sleep Analysis:</strong> Sleep duration, sleep stages, and
          sleep quality metrics to calculate your daily sleep points
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Workout Data:</strong> Workout type, duration, and energy
          burned to calculate your daily workout points
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How We Use Your Health Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>

          (sleep times, workout details) on our servers

          <strong>Points Only:</strong> Only aggregated point values derived
          from health data are stored for leaderboard purposes
        </li>
