      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 18, 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using the Better Self App ("the App"), you agree to be
        bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms, do not
        use the App.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old to use the App or participate in any
        contests. The App is available worldwide where permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Description of the Service</h2>
      <p>
        Better Self is a self-improvement and activity tracking application that
        allows users to participate in skill-based weekly contests by submitting
        daily activity logs, including photo evidence when required.
      </p>
      <p>
        The App integrates with Apple Health and Apple Watch to automatically
        track sleep and workout data. Users can also manually log activities
        such as nutrition, supplements, social interactions, mindfulness, and
        hydration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The App features an achievement system that rewards users for consistent
        activity logging and milestone completion.
      </p>

      <h2>4. User Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
        and for all activities that occur under your account. We reserve the
        right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Certain features and contest participation require payment via Apple
        In-App Purchase. The App offers auto-renewable subscriptions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment:</strong> Payment will be charged to your Apple ID
          account at the confirmation of purchase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Subscription automatically renews
          unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current
          period.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Renewal Charge:</strong> Your account will be charged for
          renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the
          same price.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Management:</strong> You can manage and cancel your
          subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after
          purchase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cancellation:</strong> Any unused portion of a free trial
          period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a
          subscription to that publication, where applicable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Payments are non-refundable once a contest has started. Payment grants
        eligibility to participate in contests but does not guarantee winnings.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Contests and Prizes</h2>
      <p>
        Contests are skill-based and determined by user activity and
        consistency. Rankings and results are final as determined by the App.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cash prizes are paid exclusively via PayPal. A valid PayPal account is
        required to receive winnings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users are responsible for any taxes or fees associated with prize
        winnings.
      </p>

      <h2>7. User Content and Photos</h2>
      <p>
        Users may be required to upload photos to verify daily activities.
        Photos are used solely for activity verification and fraud prevention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uploaded photos are stored securely and deleted within 14 days of
        submission. Photos are never displayed publicly or shared with other
        users.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Apple Health Integration</h2>
      <p>
        The App integrates with Apple Health to automatically track sleep and
        workout data. This integration requires explicit user permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Health data is used solely for calculating activity points within the
        App. We do not store raw health data on our servers; only aggregated
        point values are recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uploaded photos are stored securely and deleted within 14 days of
        submission. Photos are never displayed publicly or shared with other
        users.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Submitting false or misleading information</li>
        <li>Using automated systems to manipulate results</li>
        <li>Uploading inappropriate or illegal content</li>
        <li>Attempting to exploit or abuse the App</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Disqualification and Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to disqualify users from contests or terminate
        accounts for violations, suspected fraud, or abuse, at our sole
        discretion.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We are not
        liable for any damages arising from the use of the App, contests, or
        prize distribution.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with applicable
        laws, without regard to conflict of law principles.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App
        constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
