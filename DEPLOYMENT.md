# Deployment Instructions

To make the privacy policy accessible to Apple's App Store review bot, you need to enable GitHub Pages:

## Steps to Enable GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/manuelondina/better-self-app-privacy-policy
2. Click on "Settings" in the repository menu
3. Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main` or `copilot/add-privacy-policy-page`)
5. Select the root folder `/` as the source
6. Click "Save"

## After Enabling:

Your privacy policy will be available at:
`https://manuelondina.github.io/better-self-app-privacy-policy/`

You can use this URL in your App Store submission.

## Important Notes:

- The page may take a few minutes to become available after enabling GitHub Pages
- Make sure the repository is set to "Public" for GitHub Pages to work
- You may want to add a custom domain if desired (optional)
