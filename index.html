  <h1>Privacy Policy for My Self Improvement App</h1>

  <p>Effective Date: January 6, 2026</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    My Self Improvement App ("we", "our", or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how it is used, and how it is shared.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App collects daily activity information such as workout data, diet logs, and other actions you record through the app. Some actions may involve capturing photos via your device camera. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store any personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>
    Your activity data is used to:
    <ul>
      <li>Track your daily progress for self-improvement.</li>
      <li>Calculate points based on your actions.</li>
      <li>Display points on a leaderboard shared with other app users.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Your data is anonymized and only used in aggregate to maintain the leaderboard and personal progress tracking.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> share any personal information with third parties. The only shared data is the anonymized activity points for the leaderboard.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement reasonable security measures to protect your activity data, but no system can guarantee complete security.
  </p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
